LockedMe Application

Project Details:
Project Name: LockedMe.com
Developer: Niranjan Desai
Company: Lockers Pvt. Ltd.
Objective: To develop a prototype of the application for managing files within a directory.

Project Overview:
LockedMe.com is a CLI-based application to assist users in managing files within a specified directory. The application provides basic file handling operations such as displaying files in ascending order, adding a new file, deleting an existing file, searching for a file, and options to navigate or close the application.

Sprints Overview:
The development of LockedMe.com was divided into three major sprints:
Sprint 1: Initial Setup and Basic Features
Setting up the Git and GitHub repository.
Displaying a welcome screen with application and developer details.
Displaying the main user interface and handling invalid inputs.
Sprint 2: Core Functionality
Listing files in ascending order.
Adding a file to the directory.
Deleting a specified file.
Searching for a specified file.
Sprint 3: Final Touches and Optimization
Handling exceptions.
Implementing search and sort techniques for optimized performance.
Final testing and deployment.

Algorithms and Flowcharts:
Listing files in ascending order: Implemented using Java's Collections sort method to sort the directory list.
Add/Delete/Search file: Utilized Java's File I/O methods combined with array and list manipulations.
Flowcharts for the main operations can be visualized with dedicated tools. For the purpose of this document, only textual representations are provided.

Core Concepts and Data Structures:
Java File I/O: Used to manage file operations.
Collections: Utilized ArrayList to maintain a list of files.
Exception Handling: Integrated to handle unexpected situations like file not found or I/O errors.
Search and Sort: Used to efficiently retrieve and display files.

GitHub Repository:
LockedMe Repository
